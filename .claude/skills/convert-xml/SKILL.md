# FileMaker XML to DuckDB Conversion Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to convert a FileMaker XML export (created via SaveCopyAsXML) into a DuckDB database for analysis. The skill automates:
- UTF-16 to UTF-8 encoding conversion (if needed)
- SQL template preparation
- DuckDB database creation
- Cleanup of temporary files

## Parameters

The skill accepts **one required parameter**:
- **XML filename** - The name of the XML file in the `xml/` directory (e.g., "MyDatabase.xml")
- **--batch** or **--all** - Process all XML files in the `xml/` directory
- **--fail-fast** - Optional flag for batch mode to stop immediately on first error (for debugging)

**Single-File Mode:**
```bash
convert-xml "MyDatabase.xml"
```

**Batch Mode:**
```bash
convert-xml --batch
```

**Batch Mode with Fail-Fast (for debugging):**
```bash
convert-xml --batch --fail-fast
```

File paths are fixed:
- Input: `xml/` directory
- Output: `db/fm_catalog.duckdb`

## Workflow

### Single-File Mode

When invoked with a filename, the skill performs these steps:

1. **Validate** - Check if the XML file exists in `xml/` directory
2. **Detect Encoding** - Use `file -I` to detect file encoding
3. **Convert if Needed** - If UTF-16, convert to UTF-8 in temporary directory
4. **Prepare SQL** - Create temporary SQL script with correct paths and filename
5. **Execute DuckDB** - Run the conversion to create/update the database
6. **Cleanup** - Remove all temporary files automatically
7. **Report** - Provide simple success or error message

### Batch Mode

When invoked with `--batch`, the skill performs these steps:

1. **Discover Files** - Find all `.xml` files in `xml/` directory
2. **Validate All** - Check that all files are readable
3. **Process Sequentially** - For each file:
   - Display progress: "[15/62] Processing: Artikel.xml"
   - Measure processing time (start → end)
   - Detect encoding
   - Convert if needed
   - Import to DuckDB
   - Log file duration and status
   - Collect errors but continue to next file
4. **Build Universal Catalogs** - Create cross-file reference tables automatically
5. **Report Summary** - Show success/failure counts, list of failed files, and total duration
6. **Create Log File** - Detailed log file in `logs/` directory with per-file timings

## Available Tools

This skill uses a bundled shell script that handles all operations:
- **Script**: `scripts/convert_fm_xml.sh`
- **Usage**: Execute the script with the XML filename as argument

## Working Process

### Step 1: Accept User Request
When the user asks to convert a FileMaker XML file, extract the filename.

### Step 2: Execute Conversion Script
Run the automation script:
```bash
bash .claude/skills/convert-xml/scripts/convert_fm_xml.sh "filename.xml"
```

### Step 3: Report Results
The script will output one of:
- `SUCCESS: Database created successfully from filename.xml`
- `WARNING: Skipped — legacy SaXML v2.0.0.0 format (FMDynamicTemplate)`
- `ERROR: File not found: filename.xml`
- `ERROR: UTF-8 conversion failed`
- `ERROR: DuckDB conversion failed (exit code: X)`

Report the result to the user with appropriate context.

## Error Handling

### File Not Found
If the XML file doesn't exist in `xml/` directory, inform the user and suggest:
- Checking the filename spelling
- Verifying the file is in the `xml/` directory
- Listing available XML files with `ls xml/*.xml`

### Encoding Conversion Failed
If iconv fails (rare), this indicates:
- File permissions issue
- Corrupted XML file
- Unsupported encoding variant

Suggest checking file integrity.

### Unsupported XML Format (Skipped)
Files using the legacy `FMDynamicTemplate` root element (SaXML v2.0.0.0, FileMaker 18.x) are automatically skipped with a warning. Only `FMSaveAsXML` (SaXML v2.1.0.0+, FileMaker 19+) is supported.

### DuckDB Conversion Failed
If DuckDB fails, possible causes:
- Invalid XML structure
- Memory issues (file too large)
- Database permissions

Suggest examining the XML file or checking available disk space.

### Batch Processing Errors
If some files fail during batch processing:
- **Normal Mode**: The script continues with remaining files and reports all errors at the end
- **Fail-Fast Mode** (`--fail-fast`): The script stops immediately on first error for faster debugging
- Failed files are listed at the end in the final report (normal mode only)
- Exit code 1 if any file failed, 0 if all succeeded
- Universal catalogs are built even if some files failed (normal mode only)
- Individual error messages are shown for each failed file during processing
- Detailed error logs are written to `logs/batch_import_TIMESTAMP_errors.log`

## Output Format

Provide concise feedback:

### Single-File Mode

**Success:**
```
Successfully converted filename.xml to DuckDB database.
Database location: db/fm_catalog.duckdb
```

**Failure:**
```
Conversion failed: [specific error message]
[suggestion for resolution]
```

### Batch Mode

**Success (all files):**
```
Batch import complete!
Total files: 62
Successful: 62
Failed: 0
Total duration: 11m 27.234s (687.234 seconds)
Universal catalogs created successfully.

Log file: logs/batch_import_20260119_142345.log
Database location: db/fm_catalog.duckdb
```

**Partial Success (some files failed):**
```
Batch import complete with errors.
Total files: 62
Successful: 59
Failed: 3
Total duration: 10m 52.187s (652.187 seconds)

Failed files:
  - CorruptedFile.xml
  - InvalidStructure.xml
  - MissingData.xml

Log file: logs/batch_import_20260119_142345.log
Note: Universal catalogs were created for successfully imported files.
```

## Notes

### General
- All temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Original XML files are never modified
- The SQL template (`sql/convert_xml.sql`) remains unchanged
- No UTF-8 conversion files are left in the xml/ directory

### Single-File Mode
- Each conversion appends/updates data in the database (UPSERT semantics)
- Universal catalogs are NOT automatically created (user may import more files)

### Batch Mode
- All XML files in `xml/` directory are processed
- Universal catalogs are automatically created at the end
- Processing continues even if some files fail
- Database uses UPSERT semantics (re-importing same file updates data)
- Progress is shown for each file: "[15/62] Processing: Artikel.xml"
- Performance log is created in `logs/batch_import_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Log contains per-file processing times, total duration, and summary
- Log file location is displayed at the end of the batch import
